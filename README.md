<p>A simple mod to increase the difficulty of the game.</p>
<p>Main features of the ArmorWeight:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Armor now has weight. Depending on the total weight of the player, a new "Encumbrance" effect will be applied, which is equal to the slowness. Mobs can also be affected by weight (can be changed in the config).

  <li>HUD bar that shows current weight level and new tooltips for armor items.

  <li>The weight of an armor item can be reduced with the new "Lightness" enchantment, which reduces the weight by 15% per level.</li>
</ul>
<p>ArmorWeight is compatible with other mods that add armor items. To apply weight to such items, all you need to do is add an item entry to the config file.</p>
